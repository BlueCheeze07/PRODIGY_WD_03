This project is a simple web-based implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application allows users to play the game against each other .

The main features of the application include:
Interactive Gameplay: Users can click on cells in the grid to place their marks (X or O) and take turns playing against each other or the AI.

Visual Feedback: Winning cells are highlighted with a light yellow background colors to provide visual feedback to the players.
